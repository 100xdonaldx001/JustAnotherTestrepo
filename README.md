Tiny Life is a browser-based life simulation inspired by BitLife. The game uses draggable windows to manage your stats, actions, log and job search, all implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features

- Persistent save system backed by localStorage
- Track stats such as health, happiness, smarts, looks and addiction with random life events
- Perform actions to age up, study, work out, visit the doctor or commit crimes
- Live until a randomly determined age (roughly 80â€“120 years) before passing away naturally
- Search for jobs across multiple fields with education requirements, part-time work and economic booms or recessions
- Gain experience, promotions, bonuses and demotions through job performance and satisfaction
- Manage education from elementary school through PhD with options to drop out, re-enroll or obtain a GED
- Take out student loans that accrue interest and can be reduced with tuition assistance
- Build relationships, find partners and deal with breakups as happiness changes over time
- Commit crimes for quick cash with the risk of injuries or jail sentences that tick down each year
- Explore a real estate market with random brokers, buy and sell properties, rent to tenants, repair damage and pay property taxes
- Unlock achievements for major milestones
- Event log records the story of your life
- Character names and birth locations generated with the open-source [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev) library
