Tiny Life is a browser-based life simulation inspired by BitLife. The game uses draggable windows to manage your stats, actions, log and job search, all implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Features
- Desktop-like interface where windows can be dragged and focused
- Track stats such as health, happiness, smarts and looks
- Perform actions to age up, study, work out or commit crimes
- Live until a randomly determined age (roughly 80â€“120 years) before passing away naturally
- Search for jobs with varying salary and intelligence requirements
- Event log that records the story of your life
- Character names and birth locations generated with the open-source [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev) library

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to play. No build tools or server are required.
