## Features
- Desktop-like interface where windows can be dragged and focused
- Track stats such as health, happiness, smarts and looks
- Perform actions to age up, study, work out or commit crimes
- Search for jobs with varying salary and intelligence requirements
- Event log that records the story of your life

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to play. No build tools or server are required.
