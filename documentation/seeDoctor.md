# See Doctor

Visiting a doctor differs based on your health status:

- **Sick:** Costs $120 and cures illness. Health increases by 6–12 points.
- **Healthy:** Costs $60 and provides a 2–6 point health boost.

Seeing a doctor is not allowed while in jail.

This action interacts with these resources:

- `sick`: If true, the sickness is removed and higher cost is charged.
- `health`: Increases after a visit.
- `money`: Decreases by the visit cost.
