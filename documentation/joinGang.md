# Joining a Gang

## Join prerequisites
- Have a reputation high enough to attract interest.
- Be in a city that hosts the gang.
- Pay any entry fee or provide required items.

## Chance of acceptance
- Acceptance is not guaranteed.
- The higher the player's stats and reputation, the better the odds.
- Gang capacity can lower the chance if they are near their member limit.

## Gang state initialization
- On acceptance, the game creates a gang profile for the player.
- Initial respect, wanted level, and starting members are set.
- Territory and available resources begin at default levels.

## Influences on crime success and future gang missions
- Higher stats and better equipment boost crime success rates.
- Completing early missions increases respect, unlocking tougher jobs.
- Territory control and money determine the scale of future operations.
