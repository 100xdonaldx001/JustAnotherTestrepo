# Meditate

Meditation is a calming action that gently improves a character's outlook.

## Effects
- Slightly increases happiness through a `rand`-driven boost.
- Raises smarts with focus, while `clamp` keeps stats within bounds.
- Each session writes to the log and is treated as a low-risk morale action.

Meditation offers a reliable way to build positivity without major consequences.
